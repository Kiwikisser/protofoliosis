# Portfolio project

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website.

https://amoskampep.web.app

This website serves as a hands-on experience of my work. Especially imporant when exciting projects I have worked on in my history is confidential work, protected by NDAs.

Using only HTML, JavaScript and my beloved SCSS, I challenge myself to complex element positioning, rotation and animation. It's how I learned web development, and it frankly is how I know it best.  However, I can't lie the desire to rework this website using a SPA framework is definitely there. But that's another [future project](https://github.com/Kiwikisser/blokje/tree/development).
