# Portfolio project

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website.

https://amoskampep.web.app

This website serves as a hands-on experience of my work. Especially imporant
when exciting projects I have worked on in my history is confidential work, 
protected by NDAs.

Using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I challenge myself to complex element 
positioning, rotation and animation. It's how I learned web development, and it 
frankly is how I know it best.  However, I can't lie, the desire to rework 
this website using a SPA framework is definitely there. That's another [future 
project](https://github.com/Kiwikisser/blokje/tree/development).
